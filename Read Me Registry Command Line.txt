How to edit the Registry using Command Prompt

Important: If you're planning to use these commands on your computer, make sure to understand that modifying the Registry is risky, and it can cause irreversible damage to your installation if you don't do it correctly. It's recommended to make a full backup of your computer before proceeding.

To run reg.exe, you first need to start Command Prompt as an administrator with the following steps:

Open Start. Search for Command Prompt. Right-click the result and select Run as administrator.

To run the tool, type the following command and press Enter:

reg /?

This command will display all the operation types you can use, including:

REG Query 
REG Add 
REG Delete 
REG Copy 
REG Save 
REG Load 
REG Unload 
REG Restore 
REG Compare 
REG Export 
REG Import 
REG Flags

Note: You can also use REG followed by the operation type and /? to get more help. For example, REG QUERY /? or REG ADD /?.

You'll also get the return codes: 0 meaning that the operation completed successfully, and 1 indicating that the operation failed. However, you won't get any return codes using the Compare switch.



While there a long list of possible command combinations, below we'll be listing the most useful commands to get started using reg.exe with Command Prompt.

Wrapping things up

While you can always use the Registry Editor, you'll find that it's sometimes easier and faster to use the reg.exe command-line tool. However, at the end of the day, you will still be editing the Registry, which is dangerous no matter which tool you use.

Also, make sure to double-check your commands before executing, as you can make mistakes. For example, REG ADD HKLM\Sofware\MySubkey is not the same as REG ADD HKLM\Software\MySubkey. A mistake like that might not do anything, or it could wreck your entire system. So be careful.

If you're wondering, yes, there is a big difference between Export and Save. The command EXPORT exports registry content into a text format that you can easily distribute as a .reg file to other computers.

On the other hand, SAVE saves the registry content into a hive file format (.hiv), which preserves ownership and other important information. You should only use this command if you're restoring entries to the same computer.

It's also important to note that while you can use many of these commands on a remote computer, IMPORT and EXPORT only work on a local computer (not over the network).

Although, we're focusing this guide for Windows 10, keep in mind that reg.exe has been part of the operating system for a long time, as such this should also work on Windows 8.1 and Windows 7.
