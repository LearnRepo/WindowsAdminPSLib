***********Enable no Logon capability for user**********

- Gpedit.msc
- Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment

- Double click on "Deny log on locally" policy
- Add User or Groups
- Click on object types, "Select the type object"
- Enter object names, then check names
- Click ok

In my case I created a group and add in the policy.

Later on, I will add the user whom I don't want to have logon capabilities.

How to add users to localgroups?
net localgroup <group name> <domain>\<username> /add
